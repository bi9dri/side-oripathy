description: Update dependencies of side-oripathy (a Docusaurus static site) safely, avoiding build breakage and breaking changes. Inspect npm packages and GitHub Actions with a 7-day cooldown, check vulnerabilities via bun audit and osv-scanner, then triage packages into Batched / Individual and delegate PR creation to sub-agents. Because pushes to main are auto-deployed to GitHub Pages, the build check is mandatory. Use this skill when asked to update dependencies, respond to vulnerabilities, or bump npm packages or GitHub Actions versions.

update dependencies with following instructions

use `jq` to parse JSON outputs and `grep` to filter for relevant information.

This repository is a Docusaurus static site, and every push to `main` is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages. Therefore **any change that breaks `bun run build` results in a production outage**. Never skip the build step in the validation phase.

## Special cases

### bun

When updating Bun, update all of the following to the same version in a single commit:

- `devbox.json` — `packages[].bun@X.Y.Z`
- `package.json` — `packageManager: "bun@X.Y.Z"`
- `package.json` — `devDependencies["@types/bun"]: "X.Y.Z"`

The `bun-version` input of `oven-sh/setup-bun` does **not** need to be set: the action auto-detects the version from `package.json`'s `packageManager` field when `bun-version` is omitted. Do not add `bun-version` to workflows.

### `overrides`

Do not use `overrides` (`resolutions` in Yarn) as a default remediation strategy. Resolve issues by updating the direct dependency whenever possible. Use `overrides` only when **both** of the following apply:

1. The issue cannot be resolved by updating a direct dependency (e.g., the upstream maintainer has not released a fix yet).
2. A critical (severe) vulnerability has been reported against the transitive dependency.

When `overrides` is used as an exception, document the rationale (linked advisory, why a direct update is not viable, and removal conditions) in the PR description.

## Step 1: Deep Inspection & Security

1. Sync the environment with `bun install --frozen-lockfile`

2. To mitigate supply chain attacks, check for the latest versions released more than 7 days ago. Unless specified otherwise, check across all package managers.
```
# npm packages (the `ncu` script in package.json applies `-c 7 -p bun -w` by default)
bun run --bun ncu

# GitHub Actions
pinact run --min-age 7
```

3. Gather security information. Security updates take priority and bypass the 7-day rule in Step 1.2.
```
bun audit
osv-scanner scan source -r .
```

## Step 2: Triage

For each package detected in Steps 1.2 and 1.3, do the following:

1. Resolve the repository URL with `bun info {package} repository.url`.
2. Check the tag naming convention (e.g., whether tags are prefixed with `v`) using `gh release list -R {repo} -L 3 --json tagName -q '.[].tagName'`, so that `{from}` and `{to}` can be passed in the correct format to the next command.
3. Estimate the impact on the project and triage each package into one of two classes using `gh api repos/{repo}/compare/{from}...{to} --jq '.commits[].commit.message' | grep -iE '(^[a-z]+(\([^)]+\))?!:|BREAKING[ _-]?CHANGE|^(deprecate|remove|drop)\b)' | head -30` (this grep detects conventional commit breaking markers and fallback keywords).

Batched: no impact on project code or behavior → processed together in a single PR
Individual: likely to have impact → processed in a dedicated PR per package

**Do not over-trust SemVer. Even patch updates can contain breaking changes. That said, major updates are unconditionally treated as Individual.**

## Step 3: Orchestrate Sub-Agents

Based on the triage results, delegate update work to sub-agents.

**All PRs, issues, and commit messages must be written in Japanese.**

### Batched updates

Pass the list of Batched packages (identified in Step 2) to a single sub-agent. The sub-agent must not re-triage; it operates on the provided list.

- Work in a single git worktree and produce a single PR.
- Update packages one at a time, running the following checks after each update:
  ```
  bun run --bun typecheck && bun run --bun lint && bun run --bun format && bun run build
  ```
  - `build` verifies the Docusaurus static build. It is mandatory because main is auto-deployed.
  - If `format` (oxfmt) rewrites files, include those rewrites in the same commit.
- If checks pass, proceed to the next package (one commit per package).
- If checks fail, do not create a commit for that package. Revert to the pre-update state with `git stash && bun install --frozen-lockfile` and skip the package.
- Once all packages have been processed, create a PR containing only the packages that passed.
  - PR body: list of updated packages with before/after versions.
- On completion, report the list of skipped packages (package name, from/to versions, and a summary of the failure) to the orchestrator.

**The sub-agent must not attempt to fix skipped packages.** Report failures to the orchestrator so they can be re-triaged as Individual and handled with dedicated context.

### Re-triage by the orchestrator

When the Batched sub-agent reports skipped packages, re-triage them as Individual and add them to the Individual updates below.

### Individual updates

Packages classified as Individual (both originally Individual and those promoted from Batched) are processed by a dedicated sub-agent, git worktree, and PR per package.

- Address the following:
  - Fixes for failing checks (`typecheck` / `lint` / `format` / `build`).
  - Code improvements that leverage new or improved APIs.
  - Replacement of deprecated APIs.
- For major Docusaurus updates, consult the upstream Migration Guide and verify/apply any breaking changes affecting `docusaurus.config.ts` / `sidebars.ts` / `src/theme/` / `src/css/` (plugin API changes, swizzled component signature changes, theme class name renames, etc.).
- PR body: updated package, before/after versions, affected project code or behavior, summary of changes made, and rationale for any items left unaddressed.
- If checks still fail after 5 fix attempts (one attempt = one cycle of code change → `bun run --bun typecheck && bun run --bun lint && bun run --bun format && bun run build`), create a GitHub Issue and a Draft PR, then stop.
  - Title: `[Package Name] from vA to vB`
  - Body: error details, the upstream change causing the impact, affected project code or behavior, and approaches attempted.
  - After creating the Issue, create a Draft PR and include a link to the Issue in its description.
