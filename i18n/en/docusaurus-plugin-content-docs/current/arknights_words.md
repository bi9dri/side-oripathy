# The World and Lore of Arknights

Arknights features a unique and profound worldview, blending motifs from various historical events, myths, and legends from around the world with its own original elements.

The world is home to many different races and factions. While this supplement cannot cover them all in detail, I highly recommend watching official worldview trailers or lore videos if you find yourself intrigued.

## Terra

The name of the planet and the continent where Arknights takes place.

## Ancients

The inhabitants of Terra. While they possess intelligence and culture equivalent to Earth's humanity, they belong to various races with traits of animals such as dogs, cats, crocodiles, and birds.

Compared to Earth's humans, they possess significantly higher physical capabilities.

In addition to the Ancients, there are other peoples such as the **Elders** (with traits like Pegasus or Nine-tails) and races with demonic or angelic characteristics.

## Originium

A mineral universally found across Terra, appearing as black, translucent crystals.

It is the primary energy source in Terra but also the cause of "Catastrophes" and "Oripathy." Terra lacks coal, oil, and traditional smokeless gunpowder; Originium fulfills all these roles.

## Catastrophe

Natural disasters caused by Originium range from "Catastrophe Storms" that scatter active Originium dust to earthquakes, fissures, and even meteor strikes.

To survive these disasters, which can easily level entire cities, the people of Terra developed "Nomadic cities." Naturally, the power required to move these massive cities is also derived from Originium.

## Oripathy

A disease contracted when active Originium enters the body. It is a terrifying affliction where the body is gradually replaced by Originium until all tissues crystallize.

Oripathy is not only infectious between individuals but is also an incurable disease with a 100% mortality rate. Those afflicted are called the "Infected" and are subject to isolation or persecution in many countries.

## Rhodes Island

Rhodes Island Pharmaceutical Inc., commonly known as Rhodes Island. It is the cutting-edge pharmaceutical company to which the protagonists belong. While officially a pharmaceutical firm, it is actually a specialized organization dedicated to resolving various issues surrounding the Infected.

The organization employs many Infected individuals, consisting of not only medical staff but also combatants for conflict resolution. Some members are dispatched as representatives to various countries, including high-ranking officials.

"Rhodes Island" is also the name of the small Nomadic city owned by the organization, serving as its landship headquarters with offices established throughout Terra.

Its predecessor was an organization called **Babel**, founded in the year 1031. It was reorganized into Rhodes Island in 1094, making it a relatively new and less-known entity in Terran history. (Main Theme: Act 1 in the original game takes place 1096–1097)

## Firearms in Terra

The use of firearms in Terra is extremely limited. When creating characters, it is recommended to apply the following restrictions:
- **Characters of the "Sankta" race or affiliated with "Laterano":**
  - Can handle pistols, rifles, machine guns, bazookas, and other firearms.
- **Characters affiliated with "Rhodes Island" or "Blacksteel Worldwide (BSW)":**
  - Can handle small firearms like pistols after rigorous training.
- **Characters affiliated with "Iberia" with the "Inquisitor" profession:**
  - Can handle hand cannons after rigorous training.
- **All other characters:**
  - Generally cannot handle firearms.

This limitation is thought to be due to several complex factors (mostly based on fan theories and lore analysis):
- The physical capabilities of Ancients are far superior to Earth's humans, allowing bows and crossbows to deliver sufficient lethality.
- The existence of "Arts" (technology akin to magic) reduces the necessity for other long-range weaponry.
- Due to the unique nature of Originium-based culture, research into traditional chemical explosives has not progressed.
- Constraints potentially related to supernatural entities within the religious state of Laterano may prevent the research or refinement of explosives.

Note: While individual firearms are rare, cannons and explosives are commonly known as technologies utilizing Originium.
