# Optional Rule Extensions

You can further expand these rules to reflect the world of Arknights in even greater detail. Below are examples of how to extend the mechanics for specific races. Feel free to use these as a reference.

## Optional Rule: [Sarkaz Mercenary]

When creating a Resonator of the **Sarkaz** race, you may apply all of the following effects (they must be applied as a set).

- **Initial Erosion Level:** Starts at any value of **21 or higher**.
- **Physiological Resistance:** Becomes **1**, regardless of attribute values.
- **Erosion Cap:** A limit is placed on how much the Erosion Level can increase from a single **[Originium Erosion Check]** or **[Arts Backlash Check]**.
  - The maximum increase is equal to the character's current **[Erosion Stage]**.
  - For example, if you are at **Stage 3 (Severe)**, any rapid erosion will be capped at an increase of 3.
- **Physical Resilience:** All penalties to physical skills caused by the **Erosion Stage** are negated.
- **Social Isolation:** You always fail all Negotiation-based skill checks.
  - Interpretation: Due to deep-seated prejudice, regular dialogue is impossible. However, coercion through violence (Intimidation) is still possible.

<Memo>
Sarkaz have an "excessive" affinity for Originium, and almost all of them suffer from Oripathy. As a persecuted race in Terra, many Sarkaz find that being a mercenary is the only way to survive.

## Optional Rule: [Seaborn & Abyssal]

While retaining the Erosion Level system, you can introduce a status for **\<∞Resonance\>** to represent the Seaborn's influence.

By utilizing the standard resonance system of Emoklore TRPG, you can depict the assimilation into the **Seaborn**. When **\<∞Resonance\>** reaches **10**, the Resonator fully transforms into a Seaborn. At this point, the character is **removed from play** and becomes an NPC under the Dealer's control, as they have been assimilated into the sea monsters.

When creating a Resonator of the **Abyssal Hunters** (or Abyssal) race, apply all of the following effects:
- **Physiological Resistance:** Becomes **13**, regardless of attribute values.
- **Arts Restriction:** Cannot acquire any **\<Arts\>** skills.
- **Initial \<∞Resonance\>:** Starts at any level of **3 or higher**.
- **Perfect Resonance:** You **always result in a Perfect Match** (完全一致) during **Resonance Checks** with the Seaborn.
  - Even if **\<∞Resonance\>** is below 10, a **Howling** (極限共鳴) may cause the character to side with the Seaborn.
- **Erosion Immunity:** Ignore all effects caused by the **[Erosion Stage]**.
  - Interpretation: The disease exists within them, but it is not significant enough to affect their performance.
- **Physical Superiority:** Gain **+1 Bonus Die** to all Physical skill checks.

<Memo>
There is no Originium in the ocean of Terra; instead, there are monsters known as the Seaborn. The maritime nation of Aegir, built upon a hyper-technological civilization far beyond any land-based nation, believes the threat of these sea monsters far outweighs that of Oripathy.
