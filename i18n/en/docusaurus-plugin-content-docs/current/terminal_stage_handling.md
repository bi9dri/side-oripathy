# Handling the Terminal Stage

At the **Terminal Stage** of erosion, the Infected is almost entirely assimilated with Originium, and the disease progresses at an accelerated pace.

An **[Originium Erosion Check]** occurs approximately every hour as the character approaches the end of their struggle with Oripathy.

For these time-based checks, the **Danger Level is 8** and the **Increase is 1D10**. In most cases, the individual will transform into Originium dust within a very short period.

## Depicting Death by Oripathy

How does an Infected person meet their end? To avoid direct spoilers, the specific source is hidden, but the following is a quote from the original game's story (Episode: <span style={{color:'transparent'}}>Operation Originium Dust, OD-6 After Operation story</span>—select the text to reveal). Use this as a reference for descriptions in your scenarios or sessions.

> In the dark of the house, glittering dust crumbles from the departed's wounds and spreads throughout the enclosed space. Before long, rays of light pierce the darkness.
>
> Brilliant, dazzling, prismatic light. Originium dust floats in the air among the lights, then slowly settles.
>
> An Infected returns to the earth that birthed him.

Immediately preceding this scene, the story describes how the body was moved to a sealed room—windows, doors, vents, and every gap were plugged—to prevent the spread of Oripathy. The corpse of an Infected is a lethal source of infection.

<Memo>
The Infected have been persecuted throughout most regions and eras. The fact that the desperate danger of Oripathy manifests in a way that is obvious to anyone is undoubtedly one of the reasons for this.
