# Introduction

<Memo>
**Note on Translation:** This document has been translated from the original Japanese using an LLM. Some nuances may differ from the original text or contain unnatural phrasing.

 This is an unofficial supplement for the ["Emoklore TRPG"](https://emoklore.dicetous.com/), designed to bring the world of ["Arknights"](https://www.arknights.global/) to your table. It introduces systems for core concepts like "Oripathy" and "Arts". Please note that this is a fan-made project and is not officially affiliated with either "Emoklore TRPG" or "Arknights".

 Since these are expansion rules for "Emoklore TRPG", this document assumes you are already familiar with the [Emoklore TRPG Rulebook](https://emoklore.dicetous.com/rulebook/). While some original rules have been modified, the fundamental gameplay remains the same. Emoklore is a fantastic system; easy to play, yet offering deep customization and a truly satisfying experience. I highly encourage you to give it a try.

<Memo>
As of now, "Emoklore TRPG" only has a Japanese release. However, since the rulebook is available online for free, you may be able to find fan-made translations or use browser translation tools to help you navigate the system.

 While this supplement explains some of the Arknights setting and terminology, I recommend visiting the [Official Arknights Website](https://www.arknights.global/) for more details. Its grand, beautiful, yet harsh world-building and breathtaking music will surely captivate you. If you're interested, please try the original mobile game as well. Beyond the compelling story, its game systems and content are meticulously designed to be enjoyed by both casual and hardcore gamers. There is also an anime adaptation covering Act 1 of the main story (Episodes 0-8), which is another excellent way to experience this universe.
