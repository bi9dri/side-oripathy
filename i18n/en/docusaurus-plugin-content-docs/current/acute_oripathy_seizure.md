# [Acute Infection Seizure]

When Oripathy progresses rapidly, its symptoms manifest intensely.

If a character's Erosion Level increases by **5 or more** at once, they suffer an **Acute Infection Seizure** and take **1D3 HP damage**. If this damage reduces their HP to 0 or less, or if they take the full 3 points of HP damage, their Erosion Level increases by an additional **1D4**. A **Stun Check** (気絶判定) is not required for damage taken from this seizure.

When a seizure occurs, try roleplaying temporary symptoms such as "pain at the infection site" or "hallucinations" as listed in the **[Erosion Level]** table—especially those from a stage higher than your current one. Creating a symptom table and rolling dice to determine the effect is another great way to enhance the session. While you could create symptoms that impose skill penalties, be mindful that the existing penalties from the Erosion Stage might make calculations overly complex.

<Memo>
Oripathy stages its tragedies equally for everyone. It erodes the body with a severity that far exceeds one’s imagination.
