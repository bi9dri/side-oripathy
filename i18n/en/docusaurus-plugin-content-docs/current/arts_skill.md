# \<Arts\> Skills

**Originium Arts (Arts)** are techniques used to harness the power of Originium to trigger various phenomena. There are countless forms of Arts, including:
- Creating massive fire tornadoes.
- Manipulating gravity to levitate objects.
- Condensing atmospheric moisture to fill a glass with drinking water.
- Controlling calcium within the body to form an armor-like layer on the skin.
- Manipulating an enemy’s blood to drain their life and create thralls.
- Playing melodies that can influence or misdirect the minds of others.

Due to this extreme diversity, characters acquire these as **\<Arts: [Type]\>** skills, where **[Type]** represents the specific nature of the Arts.

For example, a character with the **\<Arts: Fire\>** skill could:

- Ignite firewood to keep warm during exploration.
- Hurl fireballs at enemies during combat.

## Character Checks and Proficiency

When performing an \<Arts\> skill check, you may choose one of the following attributes to use as the base: **[器用 (Dexterity)]**, **[精神 (Mind)]**, or **[知力 (Intelligence)]**. Your skill level is added to this attribute to determine the check value.

Unlike EX skills, \<Arts\> are acquired using standard skill points. There is no "Base Skill" (ベース技能) that can substitute for an Arts skill; **a character without an \<Arts\> skill cannot cast Arts, even if they have an Arts Unit.**

## Arts Units and the Infected

As a general rule, Arts cannot be cast without an **Arts Unit**. However, those infected with Oripathy can harness the Originium within their own bodies to cast Arts. Since this process activates the internal Originium, it triggers an **[Arts Backlash Check]**. Note that characters who are not Infected do not trigger this check, as they lack the internal Originium required to cast Arts in this manner.
