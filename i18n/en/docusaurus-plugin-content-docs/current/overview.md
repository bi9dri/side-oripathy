# Overview

- Characters possess a status called **\[Erosion Level\]** instead of \<∞共鳴\> (Resonance skill of Emoklore TRPG).
  - As the **\[Erosion Level\]** increases, penalties are applied to skill checks. If the **\[Erosion Level\]** becomes too high, the character will die.
- Characters can acquire **\<Arts: \[Type\]\>** skills to utilize various forms of **Arts**.
  - You can replace **\[Type\]** with a specific category, such as **Pyrokinesis**, **Healing**, or **Gravity**.
- Players can declare an **\[Arts Overdrive\]** to perform a high-risk, high-reward **\<Arts\>** skill check.
- Contact with active Originium or similar sources triggers an **\[Originium Erosion Check\]**. The **\[Erosion Level\]** will increase based on the result of this check.
- Using Arts under specific conditions triggers an **\[Arts Backlash Check\]**. The **\[Erosion Level\]** will increase based on the result of this check.
- If the **\[Erosion Level\]** increases by 5 or more at once, an **\[Acute Infection Seizure\]** occurs, exposing the character to a further increase in their **\[Erosion Level\]**.
